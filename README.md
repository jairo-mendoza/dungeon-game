# Dungeon Game

This is a project I worked on with a group of three over the summer during the summer program CSSIx offered by Google. The game is currently not finished but we have the basics of a dungeon crawler done.

# Technologies

We used the p5 javascript library. The user can move around using the arrow keys, and there's an enemy that will follow you around. Be careful to not let the enemy touch you!

# How to run?

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repo and open the index.html file in a web browser.
